### Cybersecurity Intern versed in creative problem-solving. Army Special Forces Veteran with 20 years of experience in Operations/Project management with a TS/SCI security clearance, and a Master's of Science in Organizational Leadership.

### Currently, I am a participating in CMSâ€™s Cyber Vets program and expect to be complete the first of November with a GSEC certification. Over the last nineteen years I have managed and directed teams and organizations from 12 to 1200 individuals across the middle east and throughout southeast Asia. Some of my strengths lie in communicating and leading across organizations, an understanding of governmental programming, budgeting, and execution cycles, developing opportunities in multicultural business environments and creating $20 solutions to $1000 problems. 

### I am looking for an opportunity to continue developing my skill set as a cyber security professional and grow within an organization. If given an opportunity I believe I could bring value to your team on day one and will remain one of your most driven and reliable employees.
