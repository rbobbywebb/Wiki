Some of my strengths lie in communicating and leading across organizations, an understanding of governmental programming, budgeting, and execution cycles, developing opportunities in multicultural business environments and creating $20 solutions to $1000 problems.I am looking for an opportunity to continue developing my skill set as a cyber security professional and grow within an organization.
